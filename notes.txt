in no more than 100 words.

Problem 1 (Name and Age): ...
i wrote a program that accepts a person's name and age as input and prints a message stating their name and how old they are.
Problem 2 (Greet Three): ...
i created a program that takes three names as input and prints a greeting that lists the names in reverse order.
Problem 3 (Day of the Week): ...
i developed a program that calculates the day of the week for a given date using a mathematical formula.
Problem 4 (Three Sort): ...
i wrote a program that takes three numbers as input and prints them in ascending order using only basic operations.
Problem 5 (Body Mass Index): ...
i implemented a program that calculates a person's body mass index based on their weight and height.
Problem 6 (Wind Chill): ...
i made a program that computes the wind chill, showing how cold it feels based on the air temperature and wind speed.
Problem 7 (Gravitational Force): ...
i developed a program that calculates the gravitational force between two objects, given their masses and the distance between them.
Problem 8 (Gambler's Ruin): ...
i wrote a program that calculates the probability of two players going in a coin-flipping game, based on their initial pennies and odds of winning.
Problem 9 (Waiting Time): ...
i created a program that calculates the probability of waiting longer than a specific time for an event to happen, based on a given rate of occurrence.
Problem 10 (Cartesian Coordinates): ...
i wrote a program that converts polar coordinates distance and angle into coordinates (x, y) and prints the results.
Problem 11 (Great Circle Distance): ...
i developed a program that calculates the shortest distance between two points on earth, using their latitudes and longitudes.
Problem 12 (Snell's Law): ...
i created a program that computes the angle of refraction when light passes between two different mediums, based on the angles and the refractive indices.
Problem 13 (Uniform Random Numbers): ...
i made a program that generates three random numbers within a given range and calculates their average, variance, and standard deviation.
Problem 14 (Die Roll): ...
i wrote a program that simulates rolling a die with n sides twice, then prints the sum of the results.
Problem 15 (Triangle Inequality): ...
i developed a program that checks if three numbers can form the sides of a triangle by applying the triangle inequality rule.
